# AirlineDatabase
## <u>[Youtube Video Demo](https://youtu.be/GEzmr_ZBh64?si=bU2MXEVi23PLal2p)<u>

This was my groups final project for CSC 455. Skills used to create this web application include php, SQL, phpMyAdmin, FileZilla, CSS, and HTML. Also very small amounts of [Javascript](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/AirlineDatabase/blob/main/php/create_passenger.php?plain=1#L97-L121). The main reason I didn't use style sheets was to make it easier to transfer the 10 files to FileZilla and keep our FileZilla folder organized and easy to modify. The CSS is embedded in style tags.

I wrote 100% of the code for this application but my team created the ERD and Schema diagrams I used to develop the database and front-end. They also wrote the summary for the project. We recieved a 'SCORE' on this project and our professor seemed to like it.

Below is the link I used that doesn't work unless you're on UNCW wi-fi or have a VPN.

The python files weren't part of the final grade, they we're just used to create the insert statements with a large number of rows 
and a wide variety of data for our database.
